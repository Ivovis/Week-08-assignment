        My Journey Through Satisfactory

        Hey there! I&apos;m Chris, and this is where I document my adventures in
        Satisfactory by Coffee Stain Studios. If you&apos;re not familiar,
        Satisfactory is a first-person open-world factory building game set on
        an alien planet â€” a delightful mix of exploration, automation, and,
        let&apos;s be honest, a fair bit of trial, error and horror. In this
        blog, I&apos;ll take you through a few of my old play-through&apos;s,
        from setting up my very first production line in a field to building
        sprawling, (in)efficient factories &#40;and the occasional chaotic
        mess&#41;. Expect progress updates, and later detailed blueprints,
        lessons learned, and maybe even a few tips to help you on your own
        industrial adventure.
