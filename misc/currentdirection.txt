What I'm going to need

Blog post table

I've opted to store the images for the blogs on the server rather than the database, maybe later this would change and I would have a dedicated table of images and the imgsrc would be a json object holding a list of images.

blog_content
    id
    title
    imgsrc                      for now a single image - may expand later to several
    blogtext                        

comments table

blog_comments
    id
    username                    limit to 20 characters
    email                       only used to verify edits and deletes - will not be displayed
    comment                     limit to 200 characters
    postid                      foreign key pointing to parent blog post


I need five images and blog texts for default/testing/dev

    Where to start, blog about the different starting locations, use image from newgame screen, talk about how common it is to mistake these locations as different planets, but then after playing for some hours on a new game you find one of the other locations you already started in.

    How to build, platforms, buildings all in factories 

    The conveyor wall factory 

    The self contained unit factories 

    Trains
